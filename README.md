# caeser cipher

A cryptography program. Also known as the shift cipher! Each letter in the input is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Project description
The user is asked which direction they want their message to shift in, what their message is going to be and their shift number.
The program will then return their encrypted message. It then asks if you want to continue or not.

## New implemented techniques
Creating my own functions, functions with inputs, keyword arguments & while loops
